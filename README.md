This research explores the application of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, to improve the accuracy and reliability of breast cancer detection in mammographic images.
By integrating traditional and new methods for denoising, feature extraction, and segmentation, the study aims to enhance image quality and diagnostic precision. 
We aim to do a comparative study between different approaches. The first approach does feature extraction with classification, second one uses segmentation with pre-trained weights and classification and the last one does segmentation on denoised images and then classification.
The models developed in this research demonstrate insights into diagnostic accuracy, offering the potential for real-world clinical applications while addressing challenges such as overfitting and the need for more diverse datasets. 
The findings contribute to the ongoing effort to advance breast cancer detection and patient outcomes through innovative AI-driven solutions.
